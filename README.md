# List Operations in Python

## Description

This script demonstrates basic list operations in Python, including:
- Creating an empty list.
- Appending multiple elements.
- Inserting an element at a specific position.
- Extending the list with another list.
- Removing the last element.
- Sorting the list in ascending order.
- Finding and printing the index of a specific value.

## How It Works

1. An empty list `my_list` is created.
2. The elements `10, 20, 30, 40` are appended to `my_list`.
3. The value `15` is inserted at the second position (index `1`).
4. The list is extended with `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. The last element is removed using `pop()`.
6. The list is sorted in ascending order.
7. The index of `30` is found and printed.
